1. Proof of logical equvalence between two different definitions of disjoint sets.
2. Proof that in any non-empty open interval bounded or unbounded there is a rational number by using LemmaB2 in page 37.
3. Proof of LemmaB9.
4 & 5. Proof of LemmaB10 in two ways by using the logical equvalence between the two different definitions of disjoint sets that is proved at the top of the page.
