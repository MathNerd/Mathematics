Let $q\in\mathbb{N}$ be some natural number and let $\mathbb{F}_q:=\{\lambda_1,\lambda_2,...,\lambda_q\}$ be an alphabet with $q$ distinct symbols (I.e. $|\mathbb{F}_q|=q$).

Let’s define a function $neq :\mathbb{F}_q\times\mathbb{F}_q\to\{0,1\}$ such that:

$$\forall x,y\in\mathbb{F}_q,neq(x,y):=
\begin{cases}
0 & x=y \\
1 & x\neq y
\end{cases}
$$ 

We’ll prove the following propositions:

**(Prop.1)** $\forall x,y\in\mathbb{F}_q, neq(x,y)\in\mathbb{Z}\land 0\leq neq(x,y)\leq 1$


**(Prop.2)** $\forall x,y\in\mathbb{F}_q, neq(x,y)=0\leftrightarrow x=y$

**(Prop.3)** $\forall x,y\in\mathbb{F}_q, neq(x,y)=neq(y,x)$

**(Prop.4)** $\forall x,y,z\in\mathbb{F}_q, neq(x,y)\leq neq(x,z)+neq(z,y)$


----------
**Proof of (Prop.1):**

Let $x,y\in\mathbb{F}_q$, Then by definition of $neq$, We get that $neq(x,y)\in\{0,1\}$, And thus $neq(x,y)\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $0\leq neq(x,y) \leq 1$ as was to be shown.

Q.E.D.

**Proof of (Prop.2):**

Let $x,y\in\mathbb{F}_q$, We’ll show that $neq(x,y)=0 \Longleftrightarrow x=y$:

$\Longrightarrow$

Suppose $neq(x,y)=0$, Then we get that it must be the case that $x=y$, Because if we suppose by contradiction that $x\neq y$, Then by definition of $neq$, We would get that $neq(x,y)=1$ which contradicts the fact that $neq(x,y)=0$. Thus it must be the case that $x=y$ as was to be shown.

$\Longleftarrow$

Suppose $x=y$, Then by definition of $neq$, We get that $neq(x,y)=0$ as was to be shown.

Q.E.D.

**Proof of (Prop.3):**

Let $x,y\in\mathbb{F}_q$, Then there are two cases **(Case.1)** $x=y$ or **(Case.2)** $x\neq y$:

**(Case.1)** If $x=y$, Then we get by the symmetric property of the $=$ relation, That it must be also the case that $y=x$, And thus we get by definition of $neq$, That $neq(x,y)=0$ and $neq(y,x)=0$, And we conclude that $neq(x,y)=neq(y,x)$.

**(Case.2)** If $x\neq y$, Then we get by the symmetric property of the $\neq$ relation, That it must be also the case that $y\neq x$, And thus we get by definition of $neq$, That $neq(x,y)=1$ and $neq(y,x)=1$, And we conclude that $neq(x,y)=neq(y,x)$.

Thus we see from cases **(Case.1)** and **(Case.2)** that it is always the case that $neq(x,y)=neq(y,x)$ as was to be shown.

Q.E.D. 

**Proof of (Prop.4):**

Let $x,y,z\in\mathbb{F}_q$, Then there are two cases **(Case.1)** $x=y$ or **(Case.2)** $x\neq y$:

**(Case.1)** If $x=y$, Then we get by definition of $neq$, That $neq(x,y)=0$, Also by **(Prop.1)** we have $0\leq neq(x,z)$ and $0\leq neq(z,y)$, And thus, We can conclude that $neq(x,y)=0=0+0\leq neq(x,z)+neq(z,y)$.

**(Case.2)** If $x\neq y$, Then we get by definition of $neq$, That $neq(x,y)=1$, Now there are two cases **(Case.2.1)** $x=z$ or **(Case.2.2)** $x\neq z$:

**(Case.2.1)** If $x=z$, Then we get by definition of $neq$, That $neq(x,z)=0$, Also by the fact that $x\neq y$, We get that it is also the case that $z\neq y$, And thus we get by definition of $neq$, That $neq(z,y)=1$, And so $neq(x,y)=1\leq 1=0+1=neq(x,z)+neq(z,y)$.

**(Case.2.2)** If $x\neq z$, The we get by definition of $neq$, That $neq(x,z)=1$, Also since by **(Prop.1)** we have $0\leq neq(z,y)$, We conclude that $neq(x,y)=1= 1+0\leq neq(x,z)+neq(z,y)$.

Therefore we conclude from cases **(Case.1)** and **(Case.2)** that it is always the case that $neq(x,y)\leq neq(x,z)+neq(z,y)$ as was to be shown.

----------

Now let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ be some natural number and let’s define a function $d:\mathbb{F}_q^n\times\mathbb{F}_q^n\to\mathbb{R}$ as follows:

$\forall \vec{x},\vec{y}\in\mathbb{F}_q^n, d(\vec{x},\vec{y}):=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)$

We’ll prove the following propositions:

**(Prop.5)** $\forall \vec{x},\vec{y}\in\mathbb{F}_q^n, d(\vec{x},\vec{y})\in\mathbb{Z}\land 0\leq d(\vec{x},\vec{y})\leq n$

**(Prop.6)** $\forall \vec{x},\vec{y}\in\mathbb{F}_q^n, d(\vec{x},\vec{y})=0\leftrightarrow \vec{x}=\vec{y}$

**(Prop.7)** $\forall \vec{x},\vec{y}\in\mathbb{F}_q^n, d(\vec{x},\vec{y})= d(\vec{y},\vec{x})$

**(Prop.8)** $\forall \vec{x},\vec{y},\vec{z}\in\mathbb{F}_q^n, d(\vec{x},\vec{y})\leq d(\vec{x},\vec{z})+ d(\vec{z},\vec{y})$


----------

**Proof of (Prop.5):**

Let $\vec{x},\vec{y}\in\mathbb{F}_q^n$, Then by definition of $d$, We get that $d(\vec{x},\vec{y})=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)$, Now by **(Prop.1)** we have $\forall i\in\{1,...,n\}, neq(x_i,y_i)\in\mathbb{Z}$, And since $\mathbb{Z}$ is closed under addition, We get that $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)\in\mathbb{Z}$, And thus $d(\vec{x},\vec{y})\in\mathbb{Z}$.

Also by **(Prop.1)** we have $\forall i \in\{1,...,n\},  0\leq neq(x_i,y_i)\leq 1$, And thus, By summing all of those inequalities together we get that $0=n\cdot 0=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n 0\leq\sum\limits_{i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)\leq \sum\limits_{i=1}^n 1=n\cdot 1=n$, And thus $0\leq d(\vec{x},\vec{y})\leq n$ as was to be shown.

Q.E.D.

**Proof of (Prop.6):**

Let $\vec{x},\vec{y}\in\mathbb{F}_q^n$, We’ll show that $d(\vec{x},\vec{y})=0 \Longleftrightarrow \vec{x}=\vec{y}$:

$\Longrightarrow$

Suppose $d(\vec{x},\vec{y})=0$, Then by definition of $d$, We get that $d(\vec{x},\vec{y})=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)$, And thus **(§.1)** $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)=0$.

Now we’ll prove by contradiction that **(§.2)** $\forall i\{1,...,n\},neq(x_i,y_i)=0$, Because If we suppose by contradiction that $\exists j\in\{1,...,n\},neq(x_j,y_j)\neq 0$, Then we get by definition of $neq$, That $neq(x_j,y_j)\in\{0,1\}$, And thus, We get that it must be the case that $neq(x_j,y_j)=1$, Now we have **(§.3)** $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)=neq(x_j,y_j)+\sum\limits_{j\neq i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)=1+\sum\limits_{j\neq i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)$, Now since by **(Prop.1)** we have $\forall i\in\{1,...,n\}\setminus\{j\},0\leq neq(x_i,y_i)$, We can conclude by summing all of those inequalities together, That $0=(n-1)\cdot 0=\sum\limits_{j\neq i=1}^n 0\leq\sum\limits_{j\neq i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)$, And thus, By adding $1$ to both sides of the inequality we would get $1\leq 1+\sum\limits_{j\neq i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)$, And by **(§.3)** we get $1\leq \sum\limits_{i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)$, But since by **(§.1)** we have $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)=0$, We conclude that $1\leq 0$ which contradicts the fact that $0\lt 1$. Thus it must be the case that $\forall i \in\{1,...,n\},neq(x_i,y_i)=0$ as was to be shown.

Now we’ll prove by contradiction that **(§.4)** $\forall i\in\{1,...,n\}, x_i=y_i$, Because if we suppose by contradiction that $\exists j\in\{1,...,n\}, x_j\neq y_j$, Then we would get by definition of $neq$, That $neq(x_j,y_j)=1$, Which contradicts the fact that it must be the case that $neq(x_j,y_j)=0$ (by **(§.2)**). Thus it must be the case that  $\forall i\in\{1,...,n\}, x_i=y_i$ as was to be shown.

And therefore we get by **(§.4)** and by definition of vector equality that $\vec{x}=\vec{y}$ as was to be shown.

$\Longleftarrow$

Suppose $\vec{x}=\vec{y}$, Then by definition of vector equality, We get that $\forall i\in\{1,...,n\}, x_i=y_i$, And thus by definition $neq$, We get that $\forall i\in\{1,...,n\},neq(x_i,y_i)=0$, And thus by definition of $d$, We would get that $d(\vec{x},\vec{y})=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n 0=n\cdot 0=0$ as was to be shown.

Q.E.D.


**Proof of (Prop.7):**

Let $\vec{x},\vec{y}\in\mathbb{F}_q^n$, Then we get by definition of $d$ that:

$d(\vec{x},\vec{y})=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)\underbrace{=}\textrm{By Prop.1}=\sum\limits_{i =1}^n neq(y_i,x_i)=d(\vec{y},\vec{x})$ 

as was to be shown.

Q.E.D.

**Proof of (Prop.8):**

Let $\vec{x},\vec{y},\vec{z}\in\mathbb{F}_q^n$, Then we get by **(Prop.4)** that $\forall i\in\{1,...,n\}, neq(x_i,y_i)\leq neq(x_i,z_i)+neq(z_i,y_i)$, Now by summing all of those inequalities together we get that $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)\leq \sum\limits_{i=1}^n\big(neq(x_i,z_i)+neq(z_i,y_i)\big)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n neq(x_i,z_i) +\sum\limits_{i =1}^n neq(z_i,y_i)$, But since by definition of $d$ we have:

$d(\vec{x},\vec{y})=\sum\limits_{i =1}^n neq(x_i,y_i)$

$d(\vec{y},\vec{z})=\sum\limits_{i =1}^n neq(y_i,z_i)$

And:

$d(\vec{z},\vec{y})=\sum\limits_{i =1}^n neq(z_i,y_i)$

We conclude that $d(\vec{x},\vec{y})\leq d(\vec{x},\vec{z})+d(\vec{z},\vec{y})$ as was to be shown.
