**Proof:**

Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ be any natural number for which $A\approx \{1,...,n\}$, Then by the fact that $A\approx \{1,...,m\}$, We get by symmetry that $\{1,...,m\}\approx A$, And thus we get by transitivity that $\{1,...,m\}\approx \{1,...,n\}$, And we conclude from **Theorem 3** that $n=m$ as was to be shown.
