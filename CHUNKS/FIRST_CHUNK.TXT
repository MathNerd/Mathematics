Measure Theory.... 


----------


> **Definition 1:**
> 
> Let $A,B\neq\emptyset$ be some non-empty sets, We’ll say that $A$ is

From the definition it is clear that the following theorem is true:
 
----------


> **Theorem 1:**
> 
> The relation above is an equivalence relation:
> 
> For any non-empty sets $A,B,C\neq\emptyset$:
> 
> **reflexivity:** $A\approx A$
> 
> **simmetricity:** $A\approx B\Longrightarrow B\approx A$
> 
> **transitivity:** $A\approx B\land B\approx C\Longrightarrow A\approx C$


----------

Now by using the notion of equivalence that we’ve just defined, We will define what is a *finite set*:


----------

> **Definition 2**
> 
> A set $A$ will be called *finite set* **if and only if** $A=\emptyset$
> or $\exists n\in\mathbb{N}, A\approx \{1,...,n\}$.


----------

Now my Measure Theory book says that:

>  "It can be shown from the definition that two *finite sets* are
> *equivalent* if and only if they have the exact same number of elements"

without actually showing it, Also it says that:

> "It can be shown that if $A$ is a *finite set* and if $B$ is another
> set such that $B\subset A$ (proper subset), Then $B$ is also a *finite
> set* and $|B|\lt |A|$ (The number of elements of $B$ is strictly less
> than the number of elements of $A$)"

So I’ve tried to fill in the details of proving it from the definition, Here’s what I’ve tried:
