Let $\{a_n\in\mathbb{R}\}_{n=1}^\infty$, Be the sequence defined by the rule $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}, a_n:=(1+\frac{1}{n})^n$, Prove that $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}, 2\leq a_n\lt 3$, And that $\forall n\in\mathbb{N},a_n\lt a_{n+1}$, And use these facts to conclude that $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}a_n$ exists.


----------

First we’ll prove that **(fact 1)** $\forall n\in\mathbb{N},\forall k\in\{0,...,n\},0\lt \frac{P(n,k)}{n^k}\leq 1$:

Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $k\in\{0,...,n\}$, There are two cases **(1)** $k=0$ or **(2)** $k\neq 0$:

Case **(1)**: If $k=0$, Then we get  $P(n,k)=P(n,0)=1$, And that $n^k=n^0=1$, And thus we have $\frac{P(n,k)}{n^k}=\frac{1}{1}=1$, But since $0\lt 1\leq 1$, We conclude that $0\lt\frac{P(n,k)}{n^k}\leq 1$.

Case **(2)**: If $k\neq 0$, Then we get that $k\in\{1,...,n\}$, We’ll prove that $\forall i\in\{1,...,k\},0\lt\frac{n-i+1}{n}\leq 1$:

Let $i\in\{1,...,k\}$, Then we have $1\leq i\leq k$, But since $k\in\{1,...,n\}$, We have $k\leq n$, And thus we can conclude that $1\leq i\leq n$, And by multiplying this inequality by $-1$, We get $-n\leq -i\leq -1$, And by adding $n$ to this inequality, We get $0=n-n\leq n-i \leq n-1$, And now after adding $1$ to the inequality, We get **(§)** $1\leq n-i+1\leq n$, Now since $n\in\mathbb{N}$, We get that $0\lt n$, And thus by dividing the inequality **(§)** by $n\gt 0$, We conclude that $\frac{1}{n}\leq\frac{n-i+1}{n}\leq\frac{n}{n}=1$, But since $0\lt n$, We get that $0\lt\frac{1}{n}$, And thus we can conclude that $0\lt\frac{n-i+1}{n}\leq 1$ as was to be shown.

Now, Since we have $\forall i\in\{1,...,k\},0\lt\frac{n-i+1}{n}\leq 1$, We can conclude that $0\lt \prod_\limits{i=1}^k\frac{n-i+1}{n}\leq 1^k=1$, But since $\prod_\limits{i=1}^k\frac{n-i+1}{n}=\frac{\prod_\limits{i=1}^k (n-i +1)}{\prod_\limits{i=1}^k n}=\frac{P(n,k)}{n^k}$, We conclude that $0\lt \frac{P(n,k)}{n^k}\leq 1$ as was to be shown.

Now we’ll prove that **(fact 2)** $\forall n\in\mathbb{N},\forall k\in\{0,...,n\},0\lt \frac{1}{k!}\cdot\frac{P(n,k)}{n^k}\leq\frac{1}{k!}$:

Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $k\in\{0,...,n\}$, By what we’ve just shown we get **(§)** $0\lt \frac{P(n,k)}{n^k}\leq 1$, And by using the fact $k!\gt 0$, We get by dividing **(§)** by $k!\gt 0$ that $0\lt \frac{1}{k!}\cdot\frac{P(n,k)}{n^k}\leq\frac{1}{k!}$ as was to be shown.

Now we’ll prove by induction that **(fact 3)** $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}, 2^{n-1}\leq n!$:

For $n=1$, We have to show that $2^{n-1}\leq n!$:

Since $2^{n-1}=2^{1-1}=2^0=1$, And since $n!=1!=1$, We conclude that $2^{n-1}\leq n!$.

Now suppose that for some $n=k\in\mathbb{N}$, We have $2^{k-1}\leq k!$, And we’ll prove that for $n=k+1$ we have $2^{(k+1)-1}=(k+1)!$:

Since $k\in\mathbb{N}$, We conclude that $1\leq k$, And thus $0\lt 2\leq k+1$, But since $2^{k-1}\leq k!$ (this is the induction hypothesis), We get by multiplying this inequality by $k+1\gt 0$ that $(k+1)2^{k-1}\leq (k+1)k!=(k+1)!$, Now by multiplying the inequality $2\leq k+1$ by $2^{k-1}\gt 0$, We get that $2^k= 2\cdot 2^{k-1}\leq (k+1)2^{k-1}$, But since we’ve already shown that $(k+1)2^{k-1}\leq(k+1)!$, We conclude that $2^k\leq (k+1)!$, But because $2^{(k+1)-1}=2^k$, We conclude that $2^{(k+1)-1}\leq (k+1)!$ as was to be shown and the proof by induction is completed.

Now we’ll prove **(fact 4)** $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}, \frac{1}{n!}\leq\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$:

Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$, Since $2^{n-1}\gt 0$ and since $n!\gt 0$, We can conclude that $2^{n-1}\cdot n!\gt 0$, Also by **(fact 3)** we get that $2^{n-1}\leq n!$, And thus by dividing this inequality by $2^{n-1}\cdot n!\gt 0$, We conclude that $\frac{1}{n!}=\frac{2^{n-1}}{2^{n-1}\cdot n!}\leq \frac{n!}{2^{n-1}\cdot n!}=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$ as was to be shown.

Now we’ll prove that **(fact 5)** $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}, \sum_\limits{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k!}\leq \sum_\limits{k=1}^n\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}=2(1-\frac{1}{2^n})\lt 2$:

Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$, By **(fact 4)** we get that in particular $\forall k\in\{1,...,n\}, \frac{1}{k!}\leq \frac{1}{2^{k-1}}$, And thus we can conclude that $\sum_\limits{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k!}\leq\sum_\limits{k=1}^n\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$.

Now let’s define a geometric sequence $\{g_m\in\mathbb{R}\}_{m=1}^\infty$, By the rules $g_1:=1$ and $\forall m\in\mathbb{N},g_m:=g_1 \cdot q^{m-1}$, Now we’ll show that $\forall m\in\mathbb{N}, g_m=\frac{1}{2^{m-1}}$: 

Let $m\in\mathbb{N}$, Then $g_m=g_1\cdot q^{n-1}=1\cdot (\frac{1}{2})^{n-1}=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$ as was to be shown.

Thus we get by the forumula for sum of geometric sequence (see *Beni Goren, Algebra, Book 4, Page 91*) that $$\sum_\limits{k=1}^n\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}=\sum_\limits{k=1}^n g_k=\frac{g_1(q^n-1)}{q-1}=\frac{1\cdot ((\frac{1}{2})^n-1)}{\frac{1}{2}-1}=\frac{\frac{1}{2^n}-1}{-\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{1-\frac{1}{2^n}}{\frac{1}{2}}=2(1-\frac{1}{2^n})$$

Now since $0\lt 2^n$, We get $0\lt\frac{1}{2^n}$ And thus $-\frac{1}{2^n}\lt 0$, And by adding $1$, We conclude that $1-\frac{1}{2^n}\lt 1$, And by multiplying by $2$, We conclude that $2(1-\frac{1}{2^n})\lt 2$.

In summary we got that $ \sum_\limits{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k!}\leq \sum_\limits{k=1}^n\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}=2(1-\frac{1}{2^n})\lt 2$ as was to be shown.
